I am scared that I would lose potential study time by seeing him. And worse if I end up liking him too much... :(,4
Apparently reality is a simulation and the programmers are messing with us at this point.,9
That comparison system could backfire when hogs see their 83rd percentile healing and go “what the fuck were our healers doing I have 83rd percentile healing”,9
I was hoping they’d put people behind him and let [NAME] pass to them super hard,8
i was feeling out of sorts restless,4
"Did you really upload a video you took, of your own cat, to whyweretheyfilming? Seriously?",7
